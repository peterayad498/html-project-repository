<p style="font-size:120%">Dialog of English
Eliza and Parry, two of the most successful early AI shows, provided a furious appearance of articulate conversation. Eliza, by Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT 's AI Laboratory, simulated a human therapist. (The details of both were first published in 1966). A human paranoiac was represented in Parry, published by Kenneth Colby, the psychiatrist at Stanford University. Psychiatrists were often not able to tell who they had been asked to decide if they communicated with Parry or a paranoiac. However, it can not be reasonably described as intelligent either in Parry or in Eliza. Parry 's contributions to the talk became canned â€” built by the programmer in advance and placed on the machine.Eliza, too, relied on canned sentences and simple programming tricks.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">AI languages of programming
Newell, Simon and Shaw have developed their Information Processing Language (IPL), a computer language tailored to AI programming, in the course of their work with GPS and logic theorists. A highly scalable data form named a list was essential to the IPL. An ordered series of data items is simply a set. Many or all objects in a collection can be lists themselves. This scheme leads to structures that are richly connected.In 1960, John McCarthy used the List Processor (LISP), the main language of work in the United States for AI, to combine elements of the IPL with a lambda calculus (a formal mathematical-logical system). In 1936, while examining the abstract decision problem, the Lambda calculus itself was invented by the logician Alonzo Church of Princeton for predicate logic, the same problem that Turing attacked when he invented the universal Turing-machine.Alain Colmerauer at the University of Aix-Marseille , France, was the first to develop the logical language programming language PROLOG (Programming en Logique) in 1973. The logician Robert Kowalski, an AI group member at the University of Edinburgh, developed PROLOG further. This language uses a powerful theorematic method called resolution that was invented in the United States in 1963. Argonne National Atomic Energy CommissionBritish logician Alan Robinson's workshop in Illinois. PROLOG may decide whether a statement is followed by other statements logically or not. In terms of, claim, 'all logicians are logical' and 'Robinson is a logician,' a system of PROLOG asks the query 'Robinson is rational?' For example, "PROLOG is widely used in AI work in Europe and Japan in particular.PROLOG has been used for complex logic programming languages by researchers at the Center for New-generation Computing Technology in Tokyo. Described as languages of the fifth century, these are used on the Institute's non-numeric parallel computers.

Other recent work includes language development to reason time-dependent data, such as "the account was paid yesterday," based on tense logic that allows statements to be located within the flow of time. (Invented in 1953 at the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch , New Zealand, by Philosopher Arthur Prior, Tense Logic)</p>

In 1965 Edward Feigenbaum from the AI and the Geneticist Joshua Lederberg from both the university of Stanford started working on a chemical analytical system, Heuristic DENDRAL (later shortened to DENDRAL). For instance, a complicated substance from carbon , hydrogen and nitrogen growing be the material to be examined. DENDRAL would hypothesize the molecular structure of the substance based on spectrographic data obtained from the substance. The performance of DENDRAL rivaled that of a chemical specialist in that task, and the program was applied in industry and academia.</p>
