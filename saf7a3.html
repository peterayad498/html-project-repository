<p style="font-size:120%">Strong AI, AI, computational simulation
Using the aforementioned approaches, AI work aims to accomplish one of three targets: solid AI, AI or cognitive simulation. Strong AI is designed to build thinking machines. (The psychologist John Searle of the University of California at Berkeley coined for this form of work the word strong AI in 1980.) The overarching goal of strong AI is to create a computer with a general intellectual capacity.A person being unchanged. The early milestones in AI show this aim in the 1950s and the 1960s, but such optimism led to an appreciation of these extreme problems. This objective was highly attractive. There have been meagreous advances to date. Some critics question whether research will in the foreseeable future even produce a system with the total intellectual capacity of an ant. Indeed, some researchers in the two divisions of AI found solid AI to be counterproductive.In order to develop economically competitive 'smart' applications, for example 'expert' medical diagnosis applications and storage network, the Implemented AI is often knowledged as advanced information processing. As mentioned in the Expert Systems portion, the Implemented AI has had considerable success.

Computers are used in cognitive simulation to test theories of human mind functioning, such as theories of people's faces recognition or memory reminder. In neuroscience and in cognitive psychology cognitive simulation is already a potent tool.</p>

Work on theory
In the mid-20th century British logician and algorithm scientist Alan Mathison Turing conducted the first significant research in the area of artificial intelligence. In 1935, Turing described an abstract computer consisting of an endless memory and a scanner that traverses the memory, symbolizes it, reads what it finds and writes further symbols. A program of instructions which is also stored in the memory dictations the action of the scanner.Symbols shape. That is the definition of Turing 's stored software, and the machine 's capacity to function and thereby alter or develop its own system is inherent in it. Turing 's concept is now commonly recognised as the Turing universal machine. In general, all modern computers are abstract turing machines.In 1950 Turing moved away from the conventional argument over intelligence concept and implemented a realistic machine intelligence test, now commonly recognised as the Turing test. Three participants participated in the Turing test: a computer, a human questioner and a human foil. In asking questions from the other two participants, the interrogator tries to determine the computer. All contact is via the computer screen and the keys. The interrogator will pose questions as ubiquitous and wide as he or she wishes and he or she must make any attempt to obtain a false identity by the machine. (In answer to,, for example, the machine might reply, "No,""You 're an equipment? "The foil must allow the questioner to classify accurately, so it may be accompanied by a challenge to subtract one number by one with long pause and an incorrect answer. A number of individuals have the role of interrogator and foil and, if the computer can't be distinguished from the human being, the computer is considered an intelligent, thinking entity (after the proponents of the Turing test).In 1991, Hugh Loebner began the annual Loebner Prize competition, promising the first Computer to take the Turing test for $100,000 each year to make the best effort. In 1991 he started his annual Loebner Prize. However, an undiluted Turing test has not occurred within an AI system.</p>
