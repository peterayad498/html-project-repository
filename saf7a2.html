<p style="font-size:120%;">Awareness
The world is screened through experience through multiple actual or artificial sensory organs, and the scene in many spatial associations is broken down into individual objects. The analysis is computed by the fact that, according to the angle, the direction and intensity of the illumination in the scene and the contrast between the object and the surrounding field, the object may appear differently.The artificial perception is currently sufficiently advanced to allow the identification of individuals by optical sensors, autonomous automobiles to drive on an open road at moderate speeds and robots to travel through houses which gather empty soda cans. FREDDY, stationary robot with rotating TV eye and hand, designed at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1966–73, was one of the first devices to combine vision and motion under the guidance of Donald Michie. FREDDY recognized a range of objects and could be instructed, from a random heap of components, to assemble simple devices , for example a toy car.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%;">language language
A language is a traditional collection of signals. Language must not in this sense be limited to the word spoken. For example , traffic signs are a minilanguage, as a question of convention which in certain countries means "hazard ahead." Languages vary from what is considered as a normal sense, and are instances of comments like: "these clouds mean rain" and "the decrease in pressure implies the valve is broken," because linguistic units have traditional definition. The linguistic sense is somewhat specific.In comparison to birdcalls and road signals, their usefulness represents an essential characteristic in full-scale human languages. An unlimited number of sentences can be formulated in a productive language.

Computer programs that seem able to answer questions and statements in a human language fluently in severely limited contexts are relatively easy to write. While none of these programmes, in principle, do understand language, they can achieve an indistinguishable control on a language from a normal one.Human. Human. Therefore, what is real comprehension if a machine uses language such as a mother-tonguer is not known to understand? The solution to this important problem is not widely accepted. One theory shows that whether you understand it or not depends not only on your conduct, but also on your history: to be told, you must have learned the language and been trained to take your place in the linguist community by interacting with other users of the language.</p>

<P style="font-size:120%;">Methods and objectives in AI
Symbolic vs. rational solutions
AI research has followed two distinct and somewhat competing methods: the symbolic approach (or "top-down") and the connectionist approach (or "bottom-up"). In order to simulate thinking, the top-down method tries to examine thought in terms of image handling — from which the abstract mark is autonomous of the biologically organized brain. The bottom-up method, however, requires constructing artificial neural networks that mimic the function of the brain – which is why the connectionist term is developed.Taking into account a device fitted with an optical scanner to classify the letters of the alphabet to highlight the disparity between both methods. In a lower-up approach, a traditional artificial neural network is trained by lettering one by one, and by "tune" the network, progressively improves performance. The top-down approach usually involves writing a computer program, which compares each letter with geometric descriptions. (The tuning adjusts the responsiveness of different neural pathways to different stimuli.) In other words, neural activity is the basis of the bottom-up approach, while the base of the top-down is the symbolic descriptionEdward Thorndike, a Columbia University educator in New York City, first proposed in The foundations of learning (1932) that human thinking consists of a certain unexplained function of neuron-related brain connections. The Organization of Behavior (1949) has suggested that learning involves strengthening certain patterns of neural activity by increasing the probability (weight) of induced neuronal fire between connections. Donald Hebb, a psychologist at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. Within a later portion, connectionism, the definition of weighted connections is defined.In 1957 two vigorous advocates of symbolic AI—Allen Newell, a researcher at the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California, and Herbert Simon, a psychologist and computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—summed up the top-down approach in what they called the physical symbol system hypothesis. This hypothesis states that processing structures of symbols is sufficient, in principle, to produce artificial intelligence in a digital computer and that, moreover, human intelligence is the result of the same type of symbolic manipulations.In the 1950's and 60's, rises and downs were pursued concurrently, with impressive, albeit minimal, outcomes being obtained. However, during the 1970s, AI from bottom-up was ignored, which became prominent again only in the 1980s. Both approaches are now being followed and both are recognized as having difficulties. Symbolic technologies work in simplified spheres but usually break down in the real world, meanwhile, the nervous systems of even the simplest living objects could not have been replicated by the bottom-up researchers. A studied worm, Caenorhabditis elegans has about 300 neurons.Its interconnection structure is well established. But still this worm could not be imitated by connectionist models. The neurons in connectionist philosophy naturally make the truth fantastic over-simplifications.</P>
